##What is a JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was developed as a light and human readable/writable data-interchange format.
It is implemented as a non language-bound text format, which uses some aspects of the C-family. 

A JSON-Document contains two structures. A collection of name and value pairs, as well as an ordered list of values.
Each name and value are separated by a colon, the pair of name and value are separated by a comma from other pairs. 
The most common content of a JSON-Document is an Object.

This can be used by a Database to store Data and provide a good format to exchange Data between Databases.
